Fr. Thomas C. Middleton, O.S.A., began as a student at Villanova in 1854 and returned to Villanova as an Augustinian professor, librarian, and archivist in 1865. As Villanova approached its 50th Anniversary, Middleton began to collect stories and documents relating to Villanova’s founding and early years, and Middleton’s *Historical Sketch of the Augustinian Monastery, Mission, and College of St. Thomas of Villanova* was published in 1893. William and Julia Moulden are mentioned in passing in Middleton’s *Historical Sketch*, but mostly overlooked.
