Located in St. Mary’s Hall on Villanova’s West Campus, this mural depicts Augustinian Fr. Matthew Carr, O.S.A., shaking hands with former President George Washington with Commodore John Barry, Thomas Fitzsimmons, and Stephen Girard standing behind Washington.


When Fr. Carr began raising money in Philadelphia in 1796 to build the first Augustinian Catholic Church in the United States, Washington, Barry, Fitzsimmons, and Girard donated $50, $150, $500, and $40, respectively.

All four of the men from whom Fr. Carr accepted these gifts were slaveowners.  No mention is made in the mural or anywhere else that the Augustinians welcomed the support of slaveholders and money made in slavery.

When Fr. Carr accepted these gifts from four slaveholding men, it had been twenty-one years since the

was founded in Philadelphia.
