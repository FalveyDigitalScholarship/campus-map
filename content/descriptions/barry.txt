John Barry Hall, Villanova University’s Naval ROTC building, is located on Villanova’s Main Campus. Barry was a U.S. Naval Officer in the eighteenth century who enslaved at least two people named Judith and James. At the time of his death in 1803, he willed Judith and James, both enslaved, to his wife Sarah Barry. Census records also indicate that he enslaved two people in 1790.


Construction on John Barry Hall began in 1947 and the building was dedicated in 1949. Today, the marker on the building reads, “This Naval ROTC building was named in honor of Commodore John Barry, a hero of the American Revolution and long regarded as the ‘Father’ of the American Navy.” Nowhere is Barry’s legacy as an enslaver reckoned with.
