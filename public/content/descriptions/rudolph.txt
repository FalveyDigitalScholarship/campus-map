Named for Jane Rudolph, Rudolph Hall is a student apartment building on Villanova’s West Campus. Born to a prominent Philadelphia Catholic family, Jane Lloyd married John Rudolph in 1936. A couple of years after her husband’s death in 1838, Jane Rudolph manumitted William Moulden from his indenture and wrote that he was honest and industrious.


After John Rudolph’s death in 1838, his Belle Air property was left to John Vodges in trust as women were not able to own property. When the Augustinians purchased the property in 1841, they purchased it from John Vodges not Jane Rudolph.


Rudolph Hall is located beside Moulden Hall and was also dedicated on October 11, 1994.
