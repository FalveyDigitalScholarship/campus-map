<p>Located on Villanova’s West Campus, Moulden Hall was named in honor of William and Julia Moulden, an African American couple who helped to found Villanova College in the nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>William Moulden was born an indentured servant to John Rudolph in about 1818. He saved the money he made in freedom to purchase property to support himself, his wife Julia, and the couple’s family. When the Augustinian friars arrived to start a college in the early 1840s, Julia and William welcomed the newcomers and continued to invest in Villanova’s success until their deaths in the 1880s. After the Augustinians purchased the property that became Villanova College in 1841, Julia and William worked for the Augustinians for forty years, they managed a shop in Rosemont where Villanova students bought snacks and sweets, and they donated money to build the church whose spires give Villanova its distinctive look to this day. At the end of his life, William donated his property, including his family’s home, to Villanova University.

<p>Moulden Hall was dedicated as a student apartment building on October 11, 1994. No markers on the buildings share William and Julia Moulden’s legacy with current residents of the Hall.
